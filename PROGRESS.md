# Twitter AI Agent Progress Report

## Current Status
- Created Twitter bot that uses Meta Llama API for generating market intelligence tweets
- Implemented tweet generation and scheduling (every 90 minutes)
- Set up environment variables in Railway
- Integrated with Twitter API using tweepy

## Latest Changes
1. Updated API integration to use correct endpoint format:
   - Base URL: `https://api-user.ai.aitech.io/api/v1/user/products/209/use`
   - Added streaming support
   - Implemented proper response handling
   - Added debug logging

2. Environment Variables Setup:
   ```
   AI_API_URL=https://api-user.ai.aitech.io/api/v1/user/products/209/use
   AI_ACCESS_TOKEN=[set in Railway]
   TWITTER_API_KEY=[set in Railway]
   TWITTER_API_SECRET=[set in Railway]
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=[set in Railway]
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=[set in Railway]
   ```

## Current Issues
1. Environment variables not being loaded in Railway deployment:
   - Variables are set in Railway but not accessible in the application
   - Debug output shows all variables as False
   - May need to investigate Railway config-as-code option

## Next Steps
1. Verify Railway Environment Variables:
   - Double-check `AI_API_URL` includes `/use` at the end
   - Ensure no whitespace in variable values
   - Consider using Railway config file

2. API Integration:
   - Test API response format
   - Add more error handling
   - Implement retry logic

3. Deployment:
   - Monitor logs for API responses
   - Test tweet generation
   - Verify scheduling works

## Files Overview
- `twitter_api_bot.py`: Main bot implementation
- `.env`: Local environment variables (gitignored)
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `PROGRESS.md`: This progress tracking file

## Dependencies
```
python-dotenv
tweepy
requests
schedule
python-dateutil
openai>=1.0.0
```

## Deployment Instructions
1. Set all required environment variables in Railway
2. Deploy using Railway
3. Monitor logs for any environment variable or API issues
4. Test tweet generation and posting

## Notes for Next Developer
- The bot is using the Meta Llama API through Solidus AI Tech's marketplace
- Environment variables need attention in Railway deployment
- Consider implementing Railway config-as-code
- Monitor API responses for correct format and error handling
