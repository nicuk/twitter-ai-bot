   - No monitoring setup

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate (Next 24-48 Hours)**
   - Set up testing framework
   - Implement missing DataSources methods
   - Configure Railway project

2. **Short Term (1 Week)**
   - Complete test coverage
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy to Railway

3. **Medium Term (2-4 Weeks)**
   - Add monitoring
   - Optimize performance
   - Enhance error handling
